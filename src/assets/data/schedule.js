    bio:
      'From outlaw country to Pink Floyd, Tim Ruffos wide range of influences creates a sound that is uniquely his own. Tim grew up listening to his mother play guitar and sing old country songs around a campfire. Those songs gave him his exposure to music as an outlet and expression of life, whether it is during hard times or times to party hard. At just 16 years old, Tim left home and joined the Air Force. His travels took him all over the country – even up to Alaska. On the road, he met new friends and listened to the stories of the real people he met along the way - wealthy, poor, young, old, those with high hopes and those who had been beaten down by life. All of those stories memories have become part of the music he writes and plays today. Tim’s main influences are Outlaw Country icons Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash who mastered the art of sharing tales of underdogs and tough times.',
    bioB:
      'But Ruffo has another, more raucous and rocking side, too, inspired by artists including Pink Floyd, Johnny Winter, and the Rolling Stones. After recording his first solo album, “Take Me Away” in 2011, Tim played shows all over New York and Pennsylvania as a solo artist and with the Tim Ruffo Band and The Ruffo Brothers. Two years later he released “Long Long Day,” with songs paying tribute to hard work, old friends, lost love, survival, and hope. His third album, MDO, featuring the songs “Told Ya,” “Livin Is Dyin,” “Katie Grace” and more was released in early 2017. Tim Ruffo has opened up for Gretchen Wilson, Eddie Money, and Joe Nichols as well as playing shows with Bloodshot artists The Deadstring Brothers and Whitey Morgan and the 78’s. Tim is always on the road, and these days he’s backed by his four-piece country rock band.',

      'Outlaw Country Artist Gene Hummel developed a love for music at a very young age at small family gatherings. At these gatherings he would often hear family members singing acapella versions of Motown and Golden Oldies hits. Not long after he developed a love for guitar. In the early 70’s, during the Outlaw Country movement, his mother purchased him his first guitar. A $50 nylon string folk model which through much trial and error Gene taught himself to play by ear. Now a veteran of well over 30 years of performing live playing many different genres of music, with too many influences to list, Gene has settled on the music he cut his teeth on, Heartbeat of America Honky Tonk Outlaw Country & Southern Rock. Gene regularly performs through out NY, PA and where ever else the road calls him. He traveled like this for many years with his former band Gator Stu and continues with current band Hummel’s Jug as well as solo. Gene has hared the stage with many great artists such as Molly Hatchet, Studebaker John and the Hawks, Brett Michaels, Blackfoot, The Fabulous Thunderbirds and Mountain, to name a few'

You’ll find simple songs of heartbreak and tales of outlaws on motorcycles on the debut self-titled album. At a live show you‘ll witness a performance that is theatrical with western inspired get-ups, soundscapes, guitar riffs and sound effects. The drummer appears to be in a love/hate relationship with his custom kit, trying to murder it in most songs only to caress it in others. This is mirrored by the guitarist’s setup of three amps that produces a clean guitar sound like something out of an old western that your grandparents would like, to a disgusting dirty, heavy and thick riff machine that will make even metalheads smile. The guitarist pulls double duty as a singer with a voice nutured by cigarettes and beer that goes from stealing your girlfriend’s heart to making Tom Waits proud.',
