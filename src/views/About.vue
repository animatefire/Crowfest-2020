      What’s the best part about bringing together a group of like-minded
      individuals? Their drive to connect with one another and support local
      causes. Crowfest is all about local music and bringing the community
      together to help our neighbors in need.
    </p>

    <h3>Great Local Music</h3>
    <p>
      This year’s festival features an outstanding line-up of excellent local
      musicians. There will be non-stop music with two stages to keep the music
      going.
    </p>

    <h3>Great Local Food</h3>
    <p>
      Our festival features some of the best and most delectable local eats
      around. Because after all, what's better than live music and amazing
      food--all for a great cause? Nothing!
    </p>

    <h3>Fireside Jam</h3>
    <p>
      Both nights will end with a fireside jam--so bring something to burn and
      an instrument to join in on the pickin' around the fire!
    </p>

    <h3>Family Friendly</h3>
    <p>
      Bring the WHOLE family! Crowfest is family and dog friendly. Bring
      everyone along to join in the fun and support a great cause! There is a
      playground and lots of space for your little ones (both 2 and 4-legged) to
      enjoy at park. Just remember to bring a leash for your dog and a way to
      scoop the poop :)
    </p>

    <h3>All Proceeds Go to Charity</h3>
    <p>
      ALL proceeds from the CrowFest will be donated to the Audie J. Mincer
      Association to assist veterans suffering from PTSD and those affected by
      cancer.

      The Audie J. Mincer PTSD/Cancer Awareness group is dedicated to helping
      those who suffer in silence from the unseen affliction known as PTSD and
      those who have been affected by cancer. The group came to life following
      the tragic loss of a family member, Audie J. Mincer, who was a Veteran and
      passed from cancer in 2014. It became a NYS registered not for profit
      corporation in 2016.
