          <p>ALL proceeds from the CrowFest will be donated to the Southern Tier Veterans Support Group to assist veterans. </p>
          <p>This yearâ€™s festival features one of our favorite lineups.  There will be non-stop music with two stages to keep the music going! </p>
          <p>Don't forget the motorcycles.  Talk to your local motorcycle clubs and get them involved or jump on your bike and take a ride through the beautiful Southern Tier ending with a day of music and food and fire! </p>
          <p>Help us celebrate the Summer Solstice!  We will be having a bonfire each night.  Bring something to burn!  Bring an instrument and join in on the pickin' around the fire!</p>
